/* For OOM, there are four reasons:
    1. external fragmentation (memory blocks inside the torch allocator but can't be used for large allocation due to discontinous objects)
    2. internal fragmentation (how much memory wasted due to unaligned memory allocations)
    3. Memory leaks from specific callsites. 
    4. Actual memory usage is larger than the capacity of GPU memory

In first stage, we aims to understand the possibility of each reason, but not necessarily of 
the detailed information. 
    1. For external fragmentation, we could track all freed objects inside the torch allocator and the pointer of un-used memory
    2. For internal fragmentation, we will track the total waste for each allocation, and deduct it for each free
    3. For memory leaks, we could track the number of allocations and deallocations for each cycle. However, how can we know the cycle?
       Or we could just use the trend of allocations (we will use 100 allocations as a pseudo cycle)
    4. For actual memory usage, driver + nondriver > capacity
